# Iterative Creative Development

Guide creative work through progressive refinement stages, preventing premature lock-in and preserving space for discovery.

---

## When to Use

- Starting a new creative project and unsure how to approach it
- Feeling stuck because you committed to details too early
- Managing creative work for others and need a framework
- Avoiding perfectionism paralysis in early stages
- User asks "How should I approach this creative project?" or "I'm stuck in the details too early" or "Charcoal to oil"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| project | Yes | The creative work being developed |
| current_state | Yes | Where it is now, what's been done |
| blockers | No | What's preventing progress |
| tendency | No | Does the creator tend toward perfectionism or rushing? |

## The Charcoal-Watercolor-Oil Method

Quincy Jones developed this framework from his experience producing music across seven decades:

"Producing music always reminds me of painting. I would always start with charcoal sketches, then I'd add watercolors, and finally oil. The charcoal sketch defines the basic shapes and proportion in broad terms - that's the way I like to start a production. The trick is to not get locked in right away - that mind-set draws from the jazz mentality."

"If you take your music from charcoal to watercolors to oil, you leave room for creativity. One of my favorite sayings is 'Let's always leave some space for God to walk through the room.'"

## The Three Stages

### Stage 1: Charcoal (Exploration)

**Purpose:** Define basic shapes and proportions in broad terms

**Characteristics:**
- Loose, rough, exploratory
- Multiple options explored
- Nothing is precious
- Mistakes are cheap
- Speed over polish
- "What if?" mindset

**Activities:**
- Brainstorming without judgment
- Quick sketches and prototypes
- Exploring multiple directions
- Finding the core idea / melody
- Identifying constraints and possibilities

**Warning Signs of Premature Advancement:**
- Debating font choices before the concept is clear
- Polishing language before the argument is structured
- Optimizing code before the architecture is sound
- Getting attached to early ideas

**Key Question:** "What are we really trying to create?"

---

### Stage 2: Watercolor (Definition)

**Purpose:** Add more definition while maintaining flexibility

**Characteristics:**
- Commitment to direction, not details
- Structure emerging from exploration
- Still room for discovery
- Testing and iteration
- Building on what works

**Activities:**
- Selecting and refining the best direction
- Adding structure and organization
- Testing with audience/users
- Identifying what's working and what isn't
- Making reversible decisions

**Warning Signs of Premature Advancement:**
- Finalizing before testing
- Defending choices that haven't been validated
- Spending time on presentation before substance

**Key Question:** "Is this the right direction?"

---

### Stage 3: Oil (Refinement)

**Purpose:** Finish with precision and craft

**Characteristics:**
- Commitment to the vision
- Attention to detail
- Polish and craft
- Execution excellence
- Irreversible decisions made carefully

**Activities:**
- Final implementation
- Quality refinement
- Edge case handling
- Presentation and packaging
- Release preparation

**Prerequisites for This Stage:**
- Direction is validated
- Core concept is solid
- Major uncertainties resolved
- Stakeholder alignment achieved

**Key Question:** "How do we make this excellent?"

## Stage Assessment Framework

| Signal | Charcoal | Watercolor | Oil |
|--------|----------|------------|-----|
| Core concept | Still exploring | Defined | Locked |
| Direction | Multiple options | Selected | Committed |
| Details | Ignored | Emerging | Perfected |
| Feedback focus | "Is this interesting?" | "Is this right?" | "Is this polished?" |
| Change cost | Free | Low | High |
| Appropriate tools | Napkin, whiteboard | Working prototype | Final medium |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

## Common Patterns and Interventions

### Pattern: Stuck in Charcoal (Can't Commit)
**Symptoms:** Endless exploration, fear of choosing, everything feels equally good/bad
**Intervention:** Set a deadline for watercolor transition. "We've explored enough. What's the strongest direction?"

### Pattern: Jumped to Oil (Premature Polish)
**Symptoms:** Debating details before structure is sound, defensiveness about early decisions
**Intervention:** Step back explicitly. "Let's take this back to watercolor. What are we still uncertain about?"

### Pattern: Perfectionism in Watercolor
**Symptoms:** Can't test because it's not ready, over-refining before validation
**Intervention:** "Good enough to learn from is good enough to test. What's the minimum we need?"

### Pattern: Rushing Through Stages
**Symptoms:** Half-baked concepts, surprised by problems late, rework
**Intervention:** "We're moving fast, but are we learning? What do we know now that we didn't before?"

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm writing a business book. I've got 50 pages of detailed content but I'm stuck. It doesn't feel right but I'm not sure why."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Creative Development Assessment

### Project
Business book on [topic]

### Current Stage: Jumped to Oil prematurely

### Evidence for Stage Assessment
- 50 pages of detailed content suggests oil-stage work
- "Doesn't feel right" suggests the direction (watercolor) wasn't validated
- Being stuck despite having content indicates structural uncertainty
- Likely started writing chapters before the book's "melody" was clear

### Stage-Appropriate Activities
1. **Step back to charcoal:** Set aside the 50 pages. What is this book really about? In one sentence?
2. **Find the melody:** What's the one idea readers should take away? If Quincy says "melody is king," what's your book's melody?
3. **Test the structure:** Before writing more, outline the journey. Does each chapter serve the melody?
4. **Validate in watercolor:** Share the outline with target readers. Does it resonate before you polish prose?

### Warning Signs to Watch
- Wanting to "just push through" the 50 pages (sunk cost thinking)
- Resisting the step-back because "so much work already done"
- Focusing on chapter-level problems when the book-level concept isn't clear

### The Key Question for This Stage
"What is this book really about, in one sentence?"

### Quincy's Reminder
"The trick is to not get locked in right away. Let's always leave some space for God to walk through the room."

**The 50 pages aren't wasted - they're your charcoal exploration. You learned what you know. Now find the melody, validate the direction, then return to refine what you've written.**
